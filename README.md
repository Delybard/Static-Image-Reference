# Static-Image-Reference

## HOWTO

1) Add your images to the Repository. Best to rename them to something descriptive or simple like 1.png, 2.png, etc.
2) In your Repository, go to `Settings` -> `Code and automation` -> `Pages` and select as `Source` `Deploy from branch`, as branch select `main`, then `/ (root)` and now click `Save`. Building the Github Page can take a few minutes, don't worry if it doesn't appear right away. Once it is done it will show you the url to your github page at the top. In my case the url is: https://delybard.github.io/Static-Image-Reference/ - don't worry if it shows you a 404 Error when you visit it!
3) The URL for your images look like this: 
  * base url / image name with file extension: 
  * https://delybard.github.io/Static-Image-Reference/1.png 
  * https://delybard.github.io/Static-Image-Reference/2.png

4) If you want to change an image for your world, just replace the image in the Images folder with a new one. But consider that it can take a few minutes for the image to update on your Github Page
